# Family Tree Algorithm

## Idea

The algorithm starts with making two arrays to make a lineage. A lineage is a group of people that are related to each other by their ancestors. Both of these arrays will pick out a random person that will then search for the closest common ancestor. Finding the closest common ancestor is necessary because the only way to find out if people are related is by finding this common ancestor. 

During this process, their depth in the lineage will be calculated. The depth will allow for the algorithm to figure out the person's connection to the other. Depending on the depth, the algorithm will figure out if the related person is a sibling, nibling, pibling, cousin, ect.
