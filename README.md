# Family Tree Algorithm

## Pseudo Code


Create a class for class Person {constructor(name, parent)}
Then create a string for each family member with their corresponding this.name = name and this.parent = parent
To start the algorithm, use the for(;;){} function for the array of person A’s parents while incrementing the depth of the family tree.
Outside of the initial for(;;){}, create an if condition to check if person A and person B are the same person
Create another for statement outside of the former: for(;;){} for(;;){}

In the second statement, check to compare person B’s parents with A’s array:
Inside the second statement, increment count, this will be used to determine B’s distance from the common relative
After ‘count’, add another for statement inside of the second statement “third statement”: for(;;){for(;;){}}
The third statement will be used with ‘i’ from the second statement to increment B and compare it to A’s algorithm.
